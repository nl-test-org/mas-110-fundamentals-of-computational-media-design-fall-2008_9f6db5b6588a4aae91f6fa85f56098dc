Description
-----------

MusicPainter is a networked graphical composing environment which aims to encourage sharing and collaboration between users. It has an easy-to-use composing interface, which turns music score into colorful painting. It guides the users to begin composing by creating mini-composition such as a melody or rhythm pattern, which we called musical brick. These bricks are collected and organized as a shared composing resource, which becomes a dynamic source of inspiration. The users can also browse and hack music pieces composed by others through the music browser. MusicPainter is not only a composing interface, it provides an environment where users can gather and learn how to compose from each other. It creates a place where different musical perspectives collide.
